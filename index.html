          variety of historical examples of ideas about artificial intelligences, and 
          discuss different understandings of how they fit into human society.

        <h4>Thursday 4/6/23: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10oUqLbnUDxaAvY7SWyt6q9kwi3SkRh9Fmn7V7Xhpv7g/view">Debating Section 230: For or Against?</a> with <a href="https://whigclio.princeton.edu/">the Whig-Cliosophic Society</a></h4>
        <p class="blurb">
          Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, first passed in 1996, is a key law regulating speech on the internet. Of particular concern is the “liability shield,” which holds that 'interactive computer services’ generally can’t be treated as the publisher or the speaker of third-party content*. In practice, this means that websites can’t be sued for the content their users post, even if it’s illegal.<br/>
          The intent behind Section 230 is to ensure that site owners can moderate their sites without worrying about legal liability, which means that this law is key to the way that websites with user-generated content, especially social media sites, function. For this reason, it’s been called “the most important law protecting internet speech” by organizations like the Electronic Frontiers Foundation. However, other actors have argued that Section 230 lets platforms get away with causing real harm to their users. Recently, the Supreme Court has considered this question in the pending case Gonzalez v. Google, where Google is being sued for hosting terrorist content that radicalized certain users on its servers.<br/>

        <h4>Monday 4/3/23: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qBtZ8CePsFZu5FK2uZT6GF9b8OBZxeoYWKWmRKfRXPc/edit?usp=sharing">Thinking Critically about the Harms of Personal Data</a></h4>
        <p class="blurb">
          "Data" is one of the most complex and important topics of the 21st century, but the current discourse around data is often very caricatural, simplistic and alarmist. The popular understanding of personal data is that it is a resource that is collected, sold, leaked; this understanding often conflates corporate and criminal uses of personal data, and oscillates between resentment at BigTech's enrichment on the back of personal data harvested from consumers and concern at the risk for identity theft and other related scams. In reality, the dangers of personal data is more complex. This talk will use several case studies (Netflix Prize, Cambridge Analytica, Clearview AI) to illustrate some of the negative impacts of personal data collection, and argue that some of the worst harms use publicly available dissemination (rather than being the result of breaches) and that some of our only protections are to appeal to the legal and regulatory system.

        <h4>Monday 3/27/23: China's Fintech: Current Developments and Trends</h4>
        <p class="blurb">Using Alipay and WeChat pay as case studies on China’s financial technology sector, we will discuss the Chinese government's role in shaping emerging markets and how these dynamics affect fintech startups in China today. 
          Alipay and WeChat Pay are two private companies with a quasi-duopoly on “last mile” payments to most customers in China. The Chinese government has grown wary of the fact that these two private companies, rather than the government-controlled banks, have much of the consumer payment data in China — a contributing factor to their recent crack-down on the tech sector. What implication does this hold for Chinese consumers, the Chinese start-up sector, and for international investors?</p>

        <p class="blurb">The Department of Defense budget for Fiscal Year 2023 is more than $851 billion, much of which is spent on contracts with the private sector. While perennial debates rage over whether this number is too big or too little, many fear the growing impact of what President Eisenhower dubbed the Military-Industrial Complex on defense policy and strategy. The advent of more advanced defense applications for computing technologies, including potential AI-enabled weapons, has further complicated this debate. Interface will be discussing all of these topics, and more.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>In the US, information hosting platforms such as Facebook & Google have been protected from liability if harmful information is published on them, under a law colloquially known as Section 230.

In the essay I briefly break down the components of parasocial attachment theory and its history to better understand how interactions with AI have the potential to draw its users into a socially dependent relationship.

        <p class='blurb'>Twitter has come to take a leading role as a public square influential in both culture and politics, a role which has sometimes put it under fire. It was also, however, a public company that had struggled to monetize its relevance. Elon Musk recently purchased Twitter promising to both bring free speech to the platform and to turn a profit. The initial results have been chaotic. But what does free speech on Twitter look like? How can it be monetized? And are these goals fundamentally in conflict? Join us to discuss and theorize how the future of Twitter will play out.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>Social media platforms have become increasingly important parts of our social, professional, and civic lives — as a result a small handful of corporations have not only profited immensely but gained immense control over and perhaps responsibility for what happens in these pseudo-public spaces. In the process they have come under heavy criticism ranging from accusations of partisan bias to insufficient moderation of hate speech or disinformation. Come join Darius Janauskas '24 to discuss who ought to control speech on these platforms and what economic, legal, and technological methods might be employed to exercise that control.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>"Right to Repair" is the idea that if you own something you should be able to repair it yourself. Over the past several years, however, many companies have made this far harder. While they often claim that this is necessary - some argue that these restrictions are to force consumers to either simply replace broken devices or buy repair services directly from the manufacturer. Come discuss why we should all be mindful of this issue, and how people are fighting to ensure the continued "Right to Repair"</p>

Furthermore, radio broadcasts have the ability to cross borders and deliver information, even when phone lines are cut, when the Internet is blocked, when access to technology is prohibitively expensive, and when illiteracy rates are high. As such, it has a significant power in shaping political and cultural outlooks among the public.

So much so that Microsoft President Brad Smith has called for a “Digital Geneva Convention” to clarify international laws concerning the nebulous world of electronic warfare and related attacks.

        <p class='blurb'>Though "design" is often associated with tech companies, Sasha Constanza-Chock reminds us in Design Justice that it is an expansive term: "design means to make a mark, make a plan, or problem-solve." In a post-techlash world where many former employees of tech companies are moving into the policy realm, I argue that we must be wary of technocratic solutionism in Washington just as much as we are beginning to decry its flaws in Silicon Valley. What can policymakers learn from the demands being made of technologists to embrace comprehensive programs of social, political, and technical change, like those found in Design Justice?</p>

        <h4>Tuesday 8/25/20: <a href="archive/2020-08-05_Health-Data-Sharing.pdf">Health data sharing in the US: what we know (or, what the government doesn't) </a><span style="color:black">ಠ_ಠ</span></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Health data has long been recognized as one of the most sensitive -- and thus best-protected -- categories of personal data. Recently, it's also become clear that the health industry is a lucrative new arena for technology companies, all of whom stand to benefit from access to protected health data in order to improve their processing or to train their models. You might hope that federal and state governments have oversight mechanisms in place to understand how and how frequently health data is shared with private companies. Boy do I have a (research-project-based, FOIA-enabled) story for you!</p>

        <p class='blurb'>Over the past few decades, financial markets have transitioned from being a bunch of humans shouting at each other in exciting places like Manhattan to being a bunch of computers quietly calculating trades in unexciting places like New Jersey. But, like so many laws, the laws which govern financial markets are rarely updated, and lag behind the technology used. I'll explore the challenges faced by engineers in finance as innovation comes up against laws which were not written with modern technology in mind.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>From satellites and commercial airplanes to restaurant pagers and proxes-  they all rely on the same means of communication: radio frequencies. We will use Software Defined Radios to decipher these signals and investigate how private and secure they can be. What can we say about the integrity of our own data permeating through wireless space and is it possible to thwart eavesdropping? </p>
