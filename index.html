        <h4>Sunday 7/25/21: <a href="https://slides.com/sunnymatt/the-elite-student-ethics-crisis">Where should I work after graduation? - A social psychology perspective</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Building off of Hien and Daniel's presentation near the end of the school year, Matthew will investigate the age-old question of "Where should I work after graduation?", not by examining different ethical frameworks, but rather from an (armchair) social psychology perspective. The aim is that looking inward and interrogating our own positionality will allow us to move forward beyond overly reductive narratives of good and bad (companies/people) and toward a more realist attitude of collective change.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 5/2/21: <a href="archive/2021-05-02_Do-you-sell-out-to-big-tech.pdf">Do you sell out to Big Tech or do you not?</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>At INTERFACE, we’ve probably all asked ourselves this at least once before. But it’s definitely not that simple, right? RIGHT? Join us as we attempt a normative zoom out on dissecting these questions.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>Cognitive enhancements can take many diverse forms, from conventional means such as education and training to more unconventional ones such as neural implants, gene therapy, and nootropic drugs. But what  happens when such enhancements becomes a commodity? Who regulates neural enhancers, and what are the implications on society at large?</p>

        <h4>Sunday 4/4/21: <a href="archive/2021-04-04_Wikipedia.pdf">The System of Crowdsourcing Wisdom</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Wikipedia - high school teachers hate it, but we all use it. In recent years, Wikipedia content has become the de facto first impression for anyone looking up anything with an article, providing 3 seconds of explanations or sources for a whole paper. But how trustworthy is Wikipedia, how does it even work and what are its pitfalls? Join us in exploring the behind-the-scenes of the world's largest encyclopedia, with all its rules, dramas, and alphabet soup.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 3/28/21: <a href="archive/2021-03-28_Pixel-Affection.pdf">Pixel Affection: Tech-Mediated Touch, Conversation, and Companionship</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>From cuddle-able Japanese robot seals designed for elderly care homes, to a proliferation of YouTube video genres such as mukbang for simulating company, to a Microsoft-developed AI chatbot girlfriend, tech-mediated companionship has slowly expanded its reach over the past twenty years. Furthermore, a year of quarantine in which friends and family are only reachable through video chat has both led to an  explosion of virtual personal interactions and a widespread deliberation of where the boundaries for such incorporeal life lies. Swing by and let's try to beat back loneliness by discussing loneliness together!</p>

        <h4>Sunday 3/21/21: <a href="archive/2021-03-21_Australian-News-Media-Bargaining-Code.pdf">Faceblock: Unfriending Australia</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>The recently passed Australian News Media Bargaining Code will significantly change the media economy in not only Australia but will likely have ripple effects around the globe. Will its end result be the saving of print media or perhaps the further forced consolidation of media companies? Does it violate fundamental norms of the web - is that a bad thing? Who won this negotiation, Google/Facebook or the Morrison Administration and what does that suggest about the power balance between tech giants and small-medium sized countries? Come discuss these things with me and hopefully we can be less confused together.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 2/28/21: <a href="archive/2021-02-21_Defence-Against-The-Dark-Ads.pdf">Defense Against the Dark Ads</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Facebook knows what you did last night. Google follows you everywhere on the Internet. In the shadows, unscrupulous data brokers aggregate and sell your data for pennies to the highest bidder. Is privacy dead? Not. Yet. Come learn about behind-the-scenes mechanisms that collect your data, and how to limit what Big Tech knows about you.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 2/21/21: <a href="archive/2021-02-21_Digital-Contact-Tracing-Revisited.pdf">Revisiting Digital Contact Tracing</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>So … what happened with all of that buzz about digital contact tracing apps? What is the role of privacy and (mis)trust of government in their adoption (or lack thereof)?
          <br><span style="font-size:0.5em">Will my citizens get mad if I promise only to use their tracing data for pandemic-related purposes and then give it to the police?</span></p>
        <p>Hien & Betsy will lead a short presentation on the current state of digital contact tracing, but we’d also love to hear all of your thoughts on pandemic-technology strats & privacy tradeoffs during our round-table discussion afterwards.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 2/14/21: Open-Source Intelligence in Journalism</h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Can you solve mysteries of the world by just looking at social media or Google Maps? This meeting, we have the pleasure of being joined by a guest who will speak about the use of open-source intelligence techniques within investigative journalism. Bellingcat journalists have applied these techniques in high-profile cases such as identifying the poisoners of Alexei Navalny.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/author/giancarlofiorella/">Giancarlo Fiorella</a> is an investigator and trainer for Latin America at Bellingcat. He is also a PhD candidate at the Centre for Criminology & Sociolegal Studies at the University of Toronto, where his research focuses on protest policing and civil conflict.</p>

        <h4>Sunday 2/7/21: <a href="archive/2021-02-07_Encrypted-Messaging-and-Society.pdf">Encrypted Messaging and Society - A Critical Look at the Rise of Telegram and Signal</a></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Both Telegram and Signal have become prominent in organizing social movements, such as the 2020 BLM and Belarus protests. At the same time, they have offered a platform for jihadists, far-right extremists, and other violent, hate-based groups. We will discuss the background of these apps and the intriguing questions they raise about the future of social movements, censorship, and countermeasures against violent extremism.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>To history buffs, Crusader memes are harmless fun. On more insidious corners of the Internet, they inspire acts of violence. Come find out how a 1000-year-old ideology became a potent radicalization tool for white supremacists and far-right extremists.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>Twitter bots emphatically denying they are bots. Troll factories that advertise open positions on Facebook. Election-related allegations against Hunter Biden.
          <br> Recently, Russian digital disinformation is in the news again. Russia is not exactly the tech capital of the world, so why is it so good at online propaganda? Can this propaganda be effective? If so, when? I will address these questions with some Russian history, results of my own research, and the collective wisdom of political science.</p>

        <p class='blurb'>The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok and WeChat. Judges blocked it, but there's more to the headlines. Is the Chinese government seriously threatening US national security through these apps? Does selling TikTok to a US company actually make a difference? What does this mean for global technology platforms? Join us for a rundown of everything that happened in this story and a discussion of what's to come.</p>

        <h4>Tuesday 8/25/20: <a href="archive/2020-08-05_Health-Data-Sharing.pdf">Health data sharing in the US: what we know (or, what the government doesn't) </a><span style="color:black">ಠ_ಠ</span></h4>
        <p class='blurb'>Health data has long been recognized as one of the most sensitive -- and thus best-protected -- categories of personal data. Recently, it's also become clear that the health industry is a lucrative new arena for technology companies, all of whom stand to benefit from access to protected health data in order to improve their processing or to train their models. You might hope that federal and state governments have oversight mechanisms in place to understand how and how frequently health data is shared with private companies. Boy do I have a (research-project-based, FOIA-enabled) story for you!</p>

        <p class='blurb'>Over the past few decades, financial markets have transitioned from being a bunch of humans shouting at each other in exciting places like Manhattan to being a bunch of computers quietly calculating trades in unexciting places like New Jersey. But, like so many laws, the laws which govern financial markets are rarely updated, and lag behind the technology used. I'll explore the challenges faced by engineers in finance as innovation comes up against laws which were not written with modern technology in mind.</p>
